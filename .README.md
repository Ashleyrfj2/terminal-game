We got this function from chatGPT, we asked for the function calling a random number that we could use to bring up a random life event. We also referenced the Mozilla website under the "getRandom" page to get a better understanding. ChatGPT gave us the name of the method, we used that information on Mozilla to verify that we were using correct formating. ChatGPT recommended the above way to do it which would of worked, but we wanted to test the method as a function. We also used chatGPT to check for syntax and spelling errors.


Feedback: 
     Would it be better to run the math.random as a function as we did or assign directly like chatGPT recommended
We are thinking in this case that function is useful if we are planning on using the Math.random more than one time throughout the code, and the chatGPT example is best for when only
needing to be used once in a specific situation

    Any feedback welcome, thank you
